Agile Development – food delivery app
Product Vision – fast and affordable food delivery
Target Group:
working professional, hostellers, families

 
Needs/Problems:
Difficult to check nearby restaurants that match their budget and taste
Lack of clarity in charges (e.g., restaurants charge, delivery fee and so on)
Poor UX on existing platforms, especially mobile
Restaurant menus are sometimes outdated or inconsistent across platforms.
 
Product:
Browse restaurants based on location, cuisine, ratings, and offers
Search for food items and restaurants
Add items to a cart and place orders with secure payment
Track delivery in real-time

Apply coupons, offers, and loyalty points
 
Business Goals:
Acquire 2 million active users in the first 12 months
Onboard 10,000 restaurants across major cities
Reduce order drop-offs by 25% through better UI & faster checkout
Achieve revenue from delivery charges
Ensure average delivery time is under 30 minutes in metro cities
Improve customer retention by 20% using loyalty programs
Reduce failed payments/issues by 40% via better payment integration
 
Challenges
Complexity in integrating with delivery partners GPS systems to show accurate live tracking.
Restaurants use different menu formats and pricing structures, making data standardization difficult.
Managing high-volume traffic during peak seasons (festivals, holidays)
Supporting multiple languages and regional preferences
Predicting delivery time using traffic, restaurant prep time, distance, and peak demand.
 
Ideas
Voice-assisted booking in native languages
Offline mode to view past orders and saved addresses
Smart delivery instructions (leave at gate, security, doorstep)
Order delay alerts via SMS/WhatsApp
Quick re-order button for frequent meals
